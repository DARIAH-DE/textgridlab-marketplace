This is a catalog software for negotiating between an Eclipse-based
program and a wiki-like software that contains additional information
about the plugins to be installed. It is a webservice run as a cgi,
implemented in Python3.

As of now, the whole program is customized to be used with a special
wiki software, namely Confluence. But parsers for other wiki systems
can of course be written quickly.
