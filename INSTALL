Requirements
- apache2 web server with modules
  - python
  - cgi
  - rewrite
- Python3
- Python3-lxml

This software can be cloned from
git@git.projects.gwdg.de:textgridlab-marketplace.git

Installation
- Create additional directory in Apache's DocumentRoot (called tgmpl
  in this example)
- Copy an icon (32x32) into that directory
- Copy the htaccess file into that directory and modify the paths
- Rename htaccess to .htaccess
- Copy the cgi and the conf file into the cgi-bin directory

Server configuration
- Enable the modules python, cgi, rewrite
- Add another directive to the site:
    <Directory /var/www/tgmpl>
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
      AllowOverride All
      Order allow,deny
      allow from all
    </Directory>
- Restart Apache

Software configuration
All of the configuration is managed in the conf file residing next to
the cgi. The values are more or less self-explanatory

Testing the installation
<server address>/cgi-bin/msInterface.cgi?action=main
should give you a valid answer
<server address>/tgmpl/api/p should do that as well
